## Services should come with stubs

This project provides stub classes for the [aws-sdk-java](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java) services to make writing good tests much easier.

[See Services should come with stubs](http://www.draconianoverlord.com/2013/04/13/services-should-come-with-stubs.html) and [Why I don't like mocks](http://www.draconianoverlord.com/2010/07/09/why-i-dont-like-mocks.html) on [Stephen's blog](http://www.draconianoverlord.com/).
